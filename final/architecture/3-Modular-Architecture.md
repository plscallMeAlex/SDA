We separate by feature (domain) 
# Topology
It group by domain 

Easy to maintain, test, and deploy or adding the 
But resuses too much cide (high coupling)
# Cloud Consider
Not suitable with a cloud because we don't know which module that integrate with cloud like we want to change cloud then you need to look through everything and use cloud and rewrite.
# Risks
It high coupling like some is changed then it might break another
# Governance
It use to control the coupling
# Team Consider
Separate into the module each person.
# Consider
Low budget and time and what a team to domain focus suitable for feature base and don't suit for more changing every time the tech stack.
